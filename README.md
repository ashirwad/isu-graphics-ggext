# Getting familiar with ggplot2 extensions

## Overview
This repository contains the source files for the talk that I gave on February 18, 2021 at the Graphics Group in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University.

## Abstract
ggplot2 is an excellent software package that allows R users to create stunning data visualizations using the grammar of graphics. Over the years, the R community has developed numerous extensions to ggplot2 that extend ggplot2's graphing capabilities and allow for creating advanced data visualizations with much ease. In this talk, I will introduce some of my most frequently used ggplot2 extensions and demonstrate their use cases using walk-through examples.
